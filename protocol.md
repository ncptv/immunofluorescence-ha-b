## 5. Procedure

### 5.1 Plate Cells

1. Five hours prior to transfection, seed 1.2 x 10⁴ HeLa ISO cells in 160 μL antibiotic-free complete media (DMEM high glucose, GlutaMAX + 10% FBS) into each well of a Corning CELLBIND clear bottom plate.  
   *Note: Agilent Cell culture/imaging clear flat bottom 96-well microplates also work.*
2. Allow the cell plate to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.  
   *If multiple plates are plated, leave them unstacked at this step.*
3. Transfer the cell plate to an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO₂ for 5 hours.  
   *If multiple plates are used, avoid stacking and place them side by side in the incubator.* 

### 5.2 Cell Transfections

1. After 5 hours, remove the cell plate from step 5.1.3 from the incubator.
2. Dispense 16 μL of Opti-MEM into each well of a 96-well Clear Round Bottom Microplate (hereafter referred to as **Round Bottom Plate 1**). 
3. Prepare a 4% Lipofectamine MessengerMAX solution in Opti-MEM. Gently mix the MessengerMAX and Opti-MEM. 
4. Dispense 12.5 μL of the Lipofectamine/Opti-MEM mixture into a separate 96-well Clear Round Bottom Microplate (hereafter referred to as **Round Bottom Plate 2**). 
5. Ensure mRNA intended for transfection has been well mixed, is plated in a 96-well Twin.tec Lobind PCR Plate, and is at a concentration of 25 ng/μL. 
6. Stamp 4 μL of the prepared mRNA from step 5.2.5 into the **Round Bottom Plate 1** prepared in step 5.2.2.
7. After addition of mRNA to **Round Bottom Plate 1**, mix well by pipette mixing. 
8. Incubate mRNA and the Opti-MEM in **Round Bottom Plate 1** for 5 minutes. 
9. Transfer 12.5 μL of the mRNA:Opti-MEM solution from **Round Bottom Plate 1** into the corresponding well containing MessengerMAX:Opti-MEM in **Round Bottom Plate 2**. Carefully pipette 20 μL up and down 15 times to ensure adequate mixing. 
10. Let **Round Bottom Plate 2** incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. 
11. Once the 10 minute incubation is complete, transfer 10 μL of the combined Opti-MEM:mRNA:Lipofectamine solution from **Round Bottom Plate 2** to each well of the plate containing HeLa ISO cells which was prepared in step 5.1. 
12. After adding the Opti-MEM:mRNA:Lipofectamine mix to cells, gently pipette 45 μL up and down 5 times. Take care to avoid disturbing the cells. 
13. Incubate the transfected HeLa ISO cell plate overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 16 hours. 
*If there are multiple plates, avoid stacking and place plates side by side in the incubator.*

   *Cover solution in aluminum foil once made to keep out of light, and store on ice until use.*  
2. From the plate washed in step 5.3.4, remove the PBS from each well taking care to avoid touching the cell layer. 
3. Add 100 μL of 4% PFA prepared in step 5.4.1 to each well. 
4. Incubate the plate at room temperature for 30 minutes. 

### 5.5 Washing away PFA

After incubating at room temperature for 30 minutes, take the cell plate from step 5.4.4 and perform the following. 

1. Remove 100 μL from each well, taking care to avoid touching the cell layer. 
2. Add 100 μL of 1x PBS to each well. 
3. Repeat steps 5.5.1 - 5.5.2 five more times. 

### 5.6 Blocking

1. From the plate washed in step 5.5.3 remove 100 μL of PBS from each well, taking care to avoid touching the cell layer. 
2. Add 100 μL of 1x PBS + 1% BSA to each well. 
3. Incubate the cell plate at room temperature for 1 hour. 

### 5.7 Primary Antibody Staining

1. Prepare a 1:2000 dilution of the primary antibody in the blocking solution. The final concentration of Influenza B (B/Massachusetts/03/2010) Hemagglutinin / HA1 Antibody,  PAb should be 500 ng/mL in 1x PBS + 1% BSA. 
2. Once prepared, keep primary antibody dilution on ice until use. 
3. After incubating at room temperature for 1 hour, take the plate from step 5.6.3 and remove the 1x PBS + 1% BSA solution from each well, taking care to avoid touching the cell layer. 
4. Add 100 μL of primary antibody solution prepared in step 5.7.1 to each well.  
5. Incubate the cell plate at 4°C overnight. 

### 5.8 Washing away Primary Antibody

After incubating at 4°C overnight, take the cell plate from step 5.6.4 and perform the following. 

1. Remove 100 μL from each well, taking care to avoid touching the cell layer. 
2. Add 100 μL of 1x PBS to each well. 
3. Repeat steps 5.8.1 - 5.8.2 five more times. 


### 5.9 Secondary Antibody Staining

1. Prepare a solution of the secondary antibody Donkey anti Rabbit Alexa Fluor 647, DAPI, and WGA in 1x PBS + 1% BSA. The desired concentrations for each component in the solution can be found in the *“Final target concentration”* column in the table below.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| For Donkey anti Rabbit Alexa Fluor 647: | EX 628/40 nm, EM 685/40 nm |
| For DAPI: 		                         | EX 377/50 nm, EM 447/60 nm |
| For WGA-CF 555: 		                   | EX 556/20 nm, EM 600/37 nm |

Imaging is performed using a BioTek Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multimode Reader or an equivalent fluorescence microscope at 10x magnification. Channel-specific settings, including illumination, integration time, and gain, should be optimized based on sample characteristics and fluorophore intensity.
